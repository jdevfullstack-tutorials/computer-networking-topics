## Server Configuration 
  
   * Internet Information Services (IIS) of Microsoft

  Note: Configuring these servers are needed in the following activities. 


## File Transfer Protocol (FTP)
  
  Why still study and use FTP? It's not dead. This is still relevant.
   Even some Android apps not only use FTP but improved it further.    
   * FTP server configuration through IIS
     * anonymous login
     * user account login
     * adding virtual directories  
        * opening an FTP site through IIS 
        * managing an FTP site through IIS    
        * mapping an FTP site and the virtual directories    
        * file transfer through an FTP site   
        * FTP Publishing  
   

## The WebDAV Extension  
  
  Why still study and use WebDAV? It's a very powerful tool.
   It predates online versioning systems
   and collaborative tools. 
   * enabling WebDAV in IIS
   * matching 32-bit and 64-bit machines 
   * WebDAV Publishing
    

## Web Development Using WAMP
  
   * static website
   * dynamic website
